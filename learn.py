print (""" Wedding Poem by Whitney Hanson Poetry
They say that sometimes
love starts with a spark.

And that might be true,
but if I were to wish you a love,
I wouldn't wish fire for you.

You see, fire is powerful.
It burns bright and then it's gone.
It's beautiful and warm,
but it doesn't last long.

So instead of wishing you a love that burns,
I wish you a love like a river twists and turns.
It changes and it flows,
It is powerful and free.
But it consistently finds its way back to the sea.

And so like the water,
I hope your love is ever growing, ever changing.
I hope your love is powerful and free,
And may you always find each other,

Like a river finds the sea.""")
